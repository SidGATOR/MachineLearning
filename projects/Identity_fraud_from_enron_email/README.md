To run the modelling tool, first run python poi_id.py. This will create run an exhaustive search on mostly used algorithms to come up with the best features and classifiers to work on thsi data.

It will also dump out the new data after you remove the outlier from it.

Then run python tester.py to see the performance of the algorithm in action
